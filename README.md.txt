# Kickstarting with Excel 
## Overview of Project 
We have a dataset full of historical data about launching campaigns from many countries globally and include many categories to study. We will explore in this project the launch dates and their funding goals, taking into consideration the results and time, and how they might be beneficial to lunch a new campaign. 
### Purpose
The mission of this analysis to make sure that you (Louis) have the needed information, provided a few insights and charts explaining how other campaigns performed to make a better decision on how you would deal with your campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges
Below is an explanation of the analysis made and some of the challenges that we have faced:
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For the first analysis, we will study the lunch date of the campaigns to get an idea about the results of the campaigns in each month to figure out the best two months to lunch a new campaign.
I used a pivot table to show the number of successful, failure, and canceled campaigns for each month for the Theater category. Then I introduced the results in a chart visualizing them in a more accessible way where the green is for successful campaigns and red is for failed campaigns.
1- We can see that most of the campaigns got launched around the middle of the year, and the least around the beginning and end of the year.
2- The highest number of successful campaigns happened in May and the lowest in December.
3- The count of Canceled campaigns is so small when compared to the other two results.
4- The count of successful campaigns is the highest every month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
For the second analysis, we will study the campaigns' goals to decide the best range to set up a goal for your campaign.
I created a table showing the count of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns based on the goal groups, where I divided the goal amounts into dollar-amount ranges for easier tracking. Also, the table shows the percentage of each result out of the total count of campaigns for each group. I used a few functions like (countif) and (sum) to create the table. Then I introduced the results in a chart visualizing them in a more accessible way where the green is for successful campaigns and red is for failed campaigns.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
1- The columns that related to dates 
2- The category and subcategory are combined in one column
Both previous limitations 
## Results
To summarize the previous analysis in few recommendations:
### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1- I recommend starting with the campaign because it is more likely to ends up successful rather than failed, and we can see that on the chart where the green line is higher than the red line for every month.
2- If the decision was made and we need to determine the best month to launch the campaign, I recommend that we started it in May or June, where the count of the successful results is significantly higher than other months.
### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1- we can notice that the first two groups where the goal less than 5k have the highest success rate at 76% for the group (Less than 1000) and 73% for the next group (1000 to 4999$) where the difference is 3% between the first group and the second one.
2- We can notice that the group of (1000 to 4999$) has the highest count of campaigns, and the difference is significant when we compare it to other groups, it is higher 1.7 times higher than the second highest group(Less than 1000) in the count
I recommend from the previous analysis to use the group (1000 to 4999$) since it has the highest count of campaigns, with a significant difference from the second one, which leads to more accuracy in the result, and I consider it as the most solid indicator.
###  What are some limitations of this dataset?
1- The columns that related to dates 
2- The category and subcategory are combined in one column
Both previous limitations
###  What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1- We can a table showing the Measures of central tendency
2- we create a box plot graph showing the Measures of spread
